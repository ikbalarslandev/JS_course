In javascript variables don't have types, values do.

We only have 6 different primitive types:

- undefined
- string
- number
- boolean
- symbol
- bigInt

> most of the things can behave like object

objects:

- object
- function (the type is function)
- array
- null

any other type instead of primitive types are referance types.
