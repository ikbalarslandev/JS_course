in javascript when we create a variable we use
`var x = 17`

but in the C++ when we do the same we need to specify the type of the variable
`int x = 17`

since we have to specify the type when we create a variable in C++ it is _statically typed_ language.

in Javascript when we create a variable we don't need to specify the type the compiler analize the the argument then set the parameter type because of that we call javascript _dynamically typed_ language.

since compiler needs to do more work to specify the type of the variable in dynamically typed languages. It take more time to compile.

> we can say statically typed languages faster
